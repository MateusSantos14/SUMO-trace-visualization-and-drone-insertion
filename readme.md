# Vehicle Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based simulation framework for tracking vehicles and drones within a specified environment. The simulation reads vehicle trace data from an XML file, supports dynamic interaction with vehicles, and can generate both visual and data outputs.

## Features

- **Read Vehicle Trace Data**: Load vehicle movements and attributes from an Trace XML file.
- **Drone Simulation**: Simulate drones following a vehicle or moving in a circular path around a specified point.
- **Add Drone or Vehicles**: Make the trace of your Vehicle with code and import it inside a simulation and visualize it.
- **Export Simulation to XML**: Update the original XML file with the current state of the simulation, and make a new XML with self made data.
- **Export to Video**: Generate a video representation of the vehicle and drone movements throughout the simulation.


## Installation

Clone this repository and ensure you have Python installed on your system. The simulation relies on external libraries; install them using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
